<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
	This is a Single Page Application created using Spring Boot 2, Angular 5 and Bootstrap 4.<br>
	It contains a simple Client CRUD where you can perform the basic operations of create, update and delete.<br>
	Besides that, the edit page also contains a Loan Simulator, which simulates a loan to the Client considering his income to define the interest rate.
	<br><br>
	You can use the navigation bar above to go to the Client List or come back here. <br>
	Give it a try :)
